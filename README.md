This Swift application embeds a machine learning model on device for real time inference to detect exercise activities typically found in a gym setting. 

Using Gyroscope and Accelerometer data, we are able to classify up to 34 different exercises after combining 3 existing data sets for training. Also working on capapbilities to fine-tune and further train our model using data collecte through this iOS client.
